# horiseon-refactor


## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that meets accessibility standards. This was accomplished by:
* refactoring index.html so that it included semantic HTML elements and updating style.css accordingly
* adding alt attributes to images in index.html
* reorganizing style.css so that attributes are ordered in correspondence to index.html
* grouping HTML attributes that share the same style in style.css so the stylesheet is more concise
* adding a title element in index.html so that the website is better positioned in search engines
