# horiseon-refactor


## Description
The purpose of this project was to update code so that the webpage better meets accessibility standards. This was accomplished by:
* refactoring index.html so that it includes semantic HTML elements and updating style.css accordingly
* reorganizing code in style.css so that attributes are ordered in correspondence to index.html
* grouping attributes that share the same style in style.css so that the stylesheet is more concise
* adding alt attributes to images
* adding a title element so that the website is better positioned in search engines
